# 国会议员投票数据分析 Analysis of Congressional Voting Data

手头有一份国会投票的数据114_congress.csv，数据集中有100行，表示100名议员的投票。当前分析目标：因为民主党和共和党投票上有不同风格，使用K-means根据他们的投票分2类验证是否如此，并找出投票异常的议员

We have a dataset titled 114_congress.csv, which contains voting data from Congress. The dataset consists of 100 rows, representing the votes of 100 legislators. The goal of the current analysis is using K-means to determine if there are distinct voting patterns between Democrats and Republicans by clustering their votes into 2 groups, thereby verifying this hypothesis. Additionally, we aim to identify any legislators with abnormal voting behavior.
